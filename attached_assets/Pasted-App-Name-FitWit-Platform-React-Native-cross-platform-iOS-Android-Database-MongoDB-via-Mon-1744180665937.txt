App Name: FitWit
Platform: React Native (cross-platform: iOS & Android)
Database: MongoDB (via MongoDB Atlas or self-hosted)
Core Concept:
FitWit is a smart health journal app that allows users to log their daily food intake, mood, exercise, sleep, hydration, and other wellness-related data. Using AI, the app analyzes user behavior over time and offers personalized feedback, patterns, and suggestions — like “You feel tired when you skip breakfast” or “Your mood improves on workout days.”
